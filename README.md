## Usage

After installation, you can use the Cypress Failure Analyzer in your testing workflow. Run your Cypress tests as you normally would:

```

Once the tests complete, you can generate the failure report:

```bash
npx cypress-failure-analyzer
```

This command will create a report that summarizes the failed tests, including error messages and stack traces.

## Configuration

You can customize the behavior of the Cypress Failure Analyzer by modifying the configuration file. Create a file named `cypress-failure-analyzer.config.js` in your project root. Here is an example configuration:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  outputDir: 'cypress/reports',
  reportFormat: 'html', // Options: 'html', 'json', 'text'
  includeScreenshots: true,
  errorDetails: true,
};
```

Adjust the options according to your needs. The generated reports will be saved in the specified `outputDir`.

## Report Generation

The Cypress Failure Analyzer generates reports that provide a clear overview of the failed tests. Each report includes:

- **Test Name**: The name of the test that failed.
- **Error Message**: A description of the error encountered.
- **Stack Trace**: A detailed stack trace for debugging.
- **Screenshots**: Optional screenshots from the test run.

To view the generated report, navigate to the output directory specified in your configuration file.
